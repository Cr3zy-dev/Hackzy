## ⚠️ Important for Kali Linux users

If you encounter an error like "externally-managed-environment" when installing modules:
- **Option 1 (quick and easy):** Install with --break-system-packages flag:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
   ```
- **Option 2 (recommended):** Use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
